# Overview
PitchForge is a web app that turns a short founder intake (voice or text) into a VC-ready, cited pitch deck. 
It performs lightweight competitor/market research, generates 10â€“12 slides (Problem, Solution, Product, Market, GTM, Competition, Business Model, Traction, Team, Roadmap, Ask) and shows a realtime deck preview.
It also lets you practice with a mock VC via browser voice. Decks export to PDF.
