Move step by step and always keep me in the loop.
Don't assume things and keep coding yourself, plan, tell me the plan, and then code. 
Don't move extremly fast and make multiple code changes at once until intructed or required. 
Move step by step and keep me in the loop. Execute step by step. 


For commands to be run in terminal, let me know and I will run them myself.
